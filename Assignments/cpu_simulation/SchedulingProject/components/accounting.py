        can simply be calculated from the given input data.

        - Number of CPU bursts needed to complete job
    - **turnaround_time** (int):
        - Turnaround time is defined as the end-to-end time a process experiences for a single CPU
        burst. More specically, this starts with the arrival time in the ready queue through to
        when the process finishes all of its CPU bursts. As such, this measure includes context
        switch times.
    - **wait_time** (int):
        - Wait time is defined as the amount of time a process spends waiting to use the CPU, which
        equates to the amount of time the given process is in the ready queue and blocked for I/O.
        Therefore, this measure does not include context switch times that the given process
        experiences (i.e., only measure the time the given process is actually in the ready queue).
    - **start_time** (int):
        - Simulation clock time when process entered ready queue.
    - **end_time** (int):
        - Simulation clock time when process left / exited the simulation.
